# CONTRIBUTING INFOS

When you pull and modify the code, we'll have to validate it.   
⚠️ - Do NOT push compiled or packed codes. We won't accept them (So **only** `.lua`, not `.lc`, `.psarc` or `.pkg`...) because we compile, pack and publish the versions releases ourself.

**WARNING!** Check the branch you're pulling/cloning/pushing!  
The **MASTER** branch is the branch with the approved and safe files  
The **PRE-RELEASE** branch is a merge of all the contributors code that must be checked/tested by us.
To contribute, you'll push to a local *head* branch, we'll approve it by merging it on the pre-release branch.
