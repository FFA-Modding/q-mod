## INSTALLATION

To install the .psarc you have to **PUT** the **.psarc** in the installation folder on the PS3, for example:
- **EUROPE DISC**: `dev_hdd0/game/BCES001954/USRDIR/data/` and throw the **patch_`xx`.psarc** in here.
- **EUROPE PACKAGE**: `NPEA00378/USRDIR/data/` and throw the **patch_`xx`.psarc** in here.
- **AMERICAN DISC**: `dev_hdd0/game/BCUS98380/USRDIR/data/` and throw the **patch** in here.
- **AMERICAN PACKAGE**: `NPUA80642/USRDIR/data/` and throw the **patch_`xx`.psarc** in here.
- **JAPANESE PACKAGE**: `NPJA00089/USRDIR/data/` and throw the **patch_`xx`.psarc** in here.

To install the **.pkg**, you have to install a **[custom firmware like CFW](https://youtu.be/y2esLWRKLPI)** or **[HFW with HEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3yjohY1Ues)** and then:
- Download the **.pkg** and put it on a USB key formatted in FAT32. Put the .pkg on "`E:\packages\`" (E:\ is an example).
- Put your USB key on a **USB port** of your PS3
- In **games category** on your XMB menu, go to "`⭐ Package Manager > 📁 Install Package File > 📁 Package Directory`"
- Select "QMFFMPatch_v`x.xx`.pkg" and **install it**.
**=> If this method don't work, use the first one.**

Start the game and try to launch a game on Markazia.
If you don't see the changes *(plasma barricades...)*, then retry to install the game or the patch.
